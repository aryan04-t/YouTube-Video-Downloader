# Here are the steps to install and configure FFmpeg on Windows:


1. Download FFmpeg:

--> Visit the FFmpeg download page for Windows: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
--> Under the "Windows Builds" section, choose a build suitable for your system (32-bit or 64-bit).
--> Download the ZIP file containing FFmpeg executable.


2. Extract FFmpeg:

--> Create a folder (e.g., "ffmpeg") on your computer where you'd like to store FFmpeg.
--> Extract the contents of the downloaded ZIP file to this folder.


3. Add FFmpeg to System PATH:

--> Open the Start menu and search for "Environment Variables" and select "Edit the system environment variables."
--> In the System Properties window, click the "Environment Variables" button.
--> In the "System Variables" section, find the "Path" variable, and click "Edit."
--> Click "New" and add the full path to the "bin" folder within the folder where you extracted FFmpeg (e.g., C:\path\to\ffmpeg\bin).
--> Click "OK" to save the changes.


4. Verify FFmpeg Installation:

--> Open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell window.
--> Type ffmpeg -version and press Enter to check if FFmpeg is recognized. You should see information about FFmpeg's version if it's correctly installed.

# How to Use This Project: 


* Open "Main.js" and enter the youtube link inside single quotes in line no. 5

* Paste the absolute path of ffmpeg.exe in line no. 49 inside the single quotes. 

* And now run "Main.js". 

* Once the program finishes its execution. 

* Use any media player and open the video which has "converted" word in the last of its name. 

* The other video which doesn't have "converted" word in its name, cannot be played, it doesn't supports media players.

# My Scenario, Confession and Goal: 


--> One of My friend gave me this projects idea and I prompted ChatGPT, used its DAN mode and made him write this final product. 

--> It took me 2 and 1/2 hours of prompting to get this final code out of ChatGPT. 

--> I am currently learning JavaScript as of 30th October 2023. 

--> I don't totally understand the code written by ChatGPT, that's why I was not able to debug it. 

--> Once I finish JavaScript and once I build more projects on my own and I understand logics and Node.js in better way, I will debug this code and I will make it 1st a full fledged working terminal project. and then I will convert it into website.
